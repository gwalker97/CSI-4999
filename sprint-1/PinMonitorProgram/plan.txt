Pin Monitor & Control Program

  Goals:
    1.) Monitor the addons registered to the Pi.
    2.) Report addon data to the server.
    3.) Allow external control of pin states.
      - We to make a protocol to exchange data. ( plan out our packets )
        i.) Data sent from Pi to server.
        ii.) Commands sent from server to Pi.

  Tasks:
    1.) Find a way to exchange data between this program and the server.
      - Should be reliable.
      - 2way channel.

--------------------

  Goal 1.) 
    There are many pins to go through, and each addon may use pins in its own way.
    Each addon should be registered and have its own object in this program in order to keep track of its parts.
      - pins, state, etc
    - Need a way to register new addons to Pi.
      + Good place for templates.
      + Keep track of addons with some kind of collection.
    - Expand the pin monitor loop to work with a collection of addons.

  Goal 2.)
    Each addon's object should contain its own reporting method, because not all addons will be the same.
    See Task 1.

  Goal 3.)
    The main program loop also needs to be extended to take in outside input from the server, and to act on it.
    See Task 1.
