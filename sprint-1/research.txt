Potential House Features:

  Things we can build:
    Remotely open or close a door.
    Detect if something approaches a door.
    Track if a door or window is open.
    Monitor temperature (inside and/or outside).

  Smart Appliances:
    Thermostat
    TV
    Fans
    Sound system
    (a lot more)

Project:

  Needs:
    Sensors/addons/appliances (for house)
    Raspberry Pi
    Control program to run on Pi
      Languages: Probably Java, or C(++).
    Server*
    UI**

  *Server Option 1:
    Raspberry Pi controls and monitors the sensors/appliances. 
    The Pi is also the central server that users interact with.
    Pros:
      May be easier to make the server, because the Pi does not need to export the data.
    Cons:
      User needs to be on the same network as the Pi, unless they have a static IP address (or they know the IP).
        Basically, it is harder to use if you are not on the same network as the PI.

  *Server Option 2:
    Raspberry Pi still controls and monitors the sensors, but now sends data to an external server.
    Pi also takes commands from that server.
    Pros:
      Pi can send data to server, because it knows the server address.
      Pi's address will then be known by the server.
    Cons:
      Security becomes harder.
      There is now a lot more data being exchanged. 

  **UI Option 1:
    Create a website with a UI to control the things in the house.
    Pros:
      Pretty portable, just need a web browser to use.
      May work better with addons we didn't build.
    Cons:
      None?
    Languages:
      HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, etc
   
  **UI Option 2:
    Create an app with a UI to control the things in the house.
    Pros:
      None?
    Cons:
      Not portable: Need to target iOS or Android.
    Language:
      Probably Java or C#.

  Compatible Addons:
    I see two categories: Things we can build, and things we can buy and add to the network.
    Things we build ourselves with LEDS/wires/etc should be built to work with the Pi's pins.
      Maybe also have templates to allow other users to add their own self-built addons.
        e.g. LED template - On, Off, status, pins
    Things we did not build may have their own app, and maybe an API.
      Best case is if it has its own local webpage a user can visit to control it.
      The project will be cooler if we can find a way to support these.
        Maybe some pre-built templates that users can add devices too if they fit.
